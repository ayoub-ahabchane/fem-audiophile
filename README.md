Welcome to Audiophile, an online audio gear store! This repository contains a demo project that I built to showcase my skills in web development. It's a part of my portfolio, and I'm excited to share it with you.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js
- Swell
- Tailwind CSS

## About the Project

Audiophile is an online store where you can find a wide range of audio gear, including headphones, speakers, and accessories. It provides a user-friendly interface for browsing and purchasing high-quality audio products.

The project was developed using Next.js, a React framework that enables server-side rendering and efficient client-side routing. Swell, a headless e-commerce platform, was used to handle the backend functionality, such as managing the product catalog, cart, and checkout process.

For the design, I utilized the design provided by Frontendmentor.com, a platform that offers design challenges to help developers enhance their skills. I focused on implementing the design faithfully while adding my own touches to improve the user experience.

## Features

- Browse and search for audio gear
- View detailed product information and specifications
